{Explain the function B(x,y)}
\end{small}


\begin{small}
B(x,y) is a function contains two real variables x and y. It could not be shown in a finite sequence among algebraic operations. Thus, it will not provide a specific answer, like it will never receive a fix answer 0. The formation of B(x,y) are varies based on x and y variables. It may or may not be a polynomial equation. \\

This function needs two variables x and y to come up with a solution. The possibilities of the function results are various. It may not be symmetry in a specific range, but it could also possibly show the monotone increasing trend in a long period. Whatâ€™s more, it can be considered as a set (x, y), or a coordinate point (x, y) on a 2D graph. For example, there is a unit circle in the xy-plane, the graph can be like:

\end{figure}



The x and y are angles of the circle centre. The coordinate $ A( \cos x , \sin x) $ are functions $  \cos x $ and $  \sin x $. This reveals that the function may not need to follow monotone trend. Besides, the answer can also be obtained through mathematics triangle definitions: $ (\sin x )^{2} + ( \cos x )^{2} = 1 $, such that the hypotenuse of the unit triangle is 1.
